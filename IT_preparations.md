## Git

Depending on your OS, you need to install git/git bash. Please follow the steps corresponding to your OS below:

### Linux distributions
- Your OS probably has git pre-installed. Open up a terminal and type:
```
git --version
```
If you get something like
```
git version 2.17.1
```
you are good to go.
- If you get `Command 'git' not found`, you need to install git. If you’re on Fedora (or any closely-related RPM-based distribution, such as RHEL or CentOS), you can use dnf:
```
sudo dnf install git-all
```
- If you’re on a Debian-based distribution, such as Ubuntu, use apt:
```
sudo apt install git-all
```
- In other cases follow the guidlines here: <https://git-scm.com/download/linux>

### Mac

- Download git from here: <https://git-scm.com/download/mac> then install it. Then open up a terminal and type:
```
git --version
```
If you get something like
```
git version 2.17.1
```
you are good to go.

### Windows

- Download git from here: <https://gitforwindows.org/> then install it.
